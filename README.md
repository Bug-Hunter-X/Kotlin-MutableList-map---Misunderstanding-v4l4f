This example demonstrates a common pitfall when using the `map` function in Kotlin with mutable lists.  The `map` function in Kotlin always returns a *new* list containing the transformed elements, leaving the original list unchanged.  This can be unexpected if you're used to languages where `map` modifies the list in-place.  The solution shows how to properly modify the mutable list using `map` and assigning the result back to the list.
